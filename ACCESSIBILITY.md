# Accessibility & Inclusive Design

## Overview
Visual Assistant is designed with accessibility as a **core system principle**, not as an optional feature.
The product prioritizes independence, safety, and dignity for users with visual impairments and other accessibility needs.

Accessibility is considered at **hardware, OS, UI, and interaction levels**.

---

## Primary Accessibility Goals
- Enable safe and independent navigation
- Reduce cognitive and sensory overload
- Provide non-visual and low-vision interaction models
- Ensure hands-free operation in daily scenarios
- Maintain privacy and user control at all times

---

## Target Accessibility Groups

### Blind Users
- Fully voice-driven interaction model
- Audio-first system feedback
- Contextual spoken alerts (obstacles, roadways, hazards)
- Braille labeling on packaging and physical controls
- No dependency on visual UI for core functionality

### Low Vision Users
- High-contrast visual overlays
- Adjustable brightness and font scaling
- Minimalist, non-intrusive UI elements
- Optional audio reinforcement of visual cues

### Elderly Users
- Simplified interaction flows
- Reduced UI complexity
- Large interaction targets
- Clear, slow-paced voice feedback
- Emergency alert prioritization

### Hands-Free / Safety-Critical Users
- Voice-only and head-gesture interaction
- No requirement for phone interaction while moving
- Automatic safety warnings in hazardous environments
- Passive monitoring without constant user input

---

## Interaction Models

### Voice Interaction
- Natural language commands
- Offline-first speech recognition where possible
- Clear confirmation and error feedback
- Configurable verbosity levels

### Physical Controls
- Tactile buttons on glasses arms
- Distinct physical differentiation for each control
- No reliance on touchscreens

### Visual Interaction (Optional)
- Minimal HUD elements
- Peripheral-friendly placement
- Context-aware activation only when necessary

---

## Safety-Oriented Accessibility Features
- Roadway and traffic detection warnings
- Environmental hazard alerts
- Attention redirection when unsafe behavior is detected
- Emergency mode with simplified command set

---

## Accessibility by Default
- Accessibility features enabled out-of-the-box
- No paid or hidden accessibility upgrades
- No requirement for external assistive hardware

---

## Privacy Considerations for Accessibility
- No continuous background recording
- Explicit user consent for all sensing features
- Local-first data processing
- Clear hardware indicators for camera and microphone usage

---

## Future Accessibility Enhancements
- Advanced spatial audio navigation
- Haptic feedback modules
- Eye-tracking for low-vision interaction
- Third-party accessibility extensions via SDK

---

## Design Philosophy
Accessibility in Visual Assistant is not a feature —  
it is **the foundation of the system design**.
