# Vector System Versions

## Overview

The Vector ecosystem is designed as a modular assistive technology platform.

Different human needs require different interfaces — not different values.  
All Vector versions share the same ethical foundation, core AI principles, and human-centered design.

Vector adapts to humans, not the other way around.
