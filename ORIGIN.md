# Project Origin

## Overview

This repository documents an early-stage **conceptual research project** exploring the idea of an AI-powered visual assistant ecosystem, primarily focused on accessibility, cognitive assistance, and ethical human-centered AI.

This is **not a finished product**, nor a commercial offering.  
It is a **public conceptual framework** intended to explore possibilities, limitations, and ethical boundaries of such systems.
