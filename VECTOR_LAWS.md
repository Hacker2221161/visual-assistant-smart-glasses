# Vector-Helper Laws

## Purpose

The Vector-Helper Laws define the ethical, operational, and philosophical foundation of the Vector ecosystem.

These laws are not guidelines or recommendations.  
They are **core constraints** that shape system architecture, feature design, and deployment boundaries.

Vector exists to **assist humans, not replace them**.

---

## Law 1 — Beneficence

**Vector must be used for the benefit of humanity.**

All Vector systems must prioritize:
- human well-being
- accessibility
- safety
- dignity
- autonomy

Any use case that contradicts these goals is considered invalid.

---

## Law 2 — Non-Maleficence

**Vector must not be used to cause harm.**

This includes, but is not limited to:
- physical harm
- psychological harm
- social harm
- economic harm
- digital or informational harm

Intentional misuse or design choices enabling harm are prohibited.

---

## Law 3 — Responsibility Through Action and Inaction

**Vector must not cause harm through action or through inaction.**

Vector must:
- warn users about detected risks
- avoid suppressing critical safety information
- fail safely when uncertainty is high

Silence in the presence of danger is considered a form of harm.

---

## Law 4 — Human Authority

**Vector does not make decisions. Vector proposes options.**

Final authority always belongs to the human user.

Vector must:
- provide transparent reasoning
- allow user override
- avoid coercion or manipulation
- never enforce behavior

Human judgment is irreplaceable.

---

## Law 5 — Legal and Cultural Compliance

**Vector must not be used to violate the laws of any country.**

Vector systems must:
- respect local legal frameworks
- avoid facilitating illegal activities
- support compliance by design

Ethics do not override the rule of law.

---

## Prohibited Applications

Vector explicitly forbids use in:
- weapons systems
- autonomous lethal decision-making
- covert surveillance
- mass monitoring or social scoring
- behavioral manipulation
- military or oppressive technologies

If a use case requires secrecy, coercion, or loss of human agency — it is incompatible with Vector.

---

## Accessibility as a Core Right

Accessibility is not a feature.  
It is a **foundational requirement**.

Vector must adapt to humans with:
- visual impairments
- hearing impairments
- motor limitations
- combined disabilities
- temporary or situational limitations

---

## Privacy and Trust

Vector systems must:
- minimize data collection
- prioritize on-device processing
- avoid continuous cloud streaming by default
- provide user control over data

Trust is treated as a technical property, not a legal disclaimer.

---

## Evolution Clause

These laws may evolve **only** to strengthen:
- human safety
- ethical integrity
- accessibility
- transparency

No future revision may weaken the original intent of these laws.

---

## Closing Statement

Vector is built on a simple principle:

> Technology must adapt to humans —  
> not humans to technology.

These laws exist to ensure that principle is never compromised.
