# Vector Helper

**Vector Helper** is a modular AI-based personal assistance ecosystem
designed to improve accessibility, reduce cognitive overload,
and provide equal digital access for all users.

The system is built from the ground up to adapt to different
physical, sensory, and cognitive abilities.

---

## Ecosystem

Vector Helper is designed as an ecosystem, not a single device.

- Smart glasses
- Accessibility accessories
- Haptic interfaces
- AI-enabled wheelchairs
- Future neural interfaces

Each component can operate:
- Independently
- Or as part of a unified system

---

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture:

- Core AI
- Interface Modules
- Accessibility Layer
- Device Abstraction Layer
- Ethics & Safety Layer

This structure allows new interfaces, devices, and editions
to be added without redesigning the entire system.

---

## Ethics

The project follows **Vector Helper Laws**  
(see `LAWS.md`)

Ethical constraints are enforced at the system level.

---

## Project Status

**Stage:** Concept / Early Architecture  
**Open for:** Research, discussion, architectural contributions

---

## Contribution

The project is currently focused on defining a strong
architectural and ethical foundation.

Ideas, design discussions, and conceptual contributions are welcome.
