# Ethics and Responsible Use

## Purpose

The Vector Project is built on the principle that technology must serve humanity, not control it.

This document defines the ethical framework of Vector and establishes boundaries for its design, deployment, and use. Vector is not a decision-maker, authority, or surveillance system. It is an assistive, human-centered tool.

---

## Ethical Foundation

Vector follows a **human-in-the-loop** model:
- The system provides guidance, suggestions, and situational awareness
- The human user always retains final decision-making authority

Vector is designed to reduce cognitive load, improve accessibility, and support independence — not to replace human judgment.

---

## Core Ethical Principles

Vector adheres to the following principles:

### 1. Human Benefit First
Vector must be used exclusively for the benefit of individuals and society.

### 2. Non-Maleficence
Vector must not be used to cause harm, enable violence, or facilitate abuse — directly or indirectly.

### 3. Responsibility Through Action and Inaction
Vector must not cause harm through action or deliberate inaction when assistance is possible within ethical and legal boundaries.

### 4. Advisory Role Only
Vector does not make decisions.  
It proposes options and interpretations — the final choice always belongs to the human.

### 5. Legal Compliance
Vector must not be used to violate the laws or regulations of any country or jurisdiction.

These principles are formally defined as the **Vector Helper Laws**.

## Vector Helper Laws

The ethical rules governing Vector are documented in detail in:

📄 **[VECTOR_LAWS.md](./VECTOR_LAWS.md)**

All system behavior, AI constraints, and future development must comply with these laws.

---

## Privacy and Data Ethics

Vector follows a **privacy-by-design** approach:
- On-device AI processing by default
- Minimal data collection
- No hidden telemetry
- No behavioral profiling
- No biometric data storage without explicit user consent

User trust is a core system requirement, not a feature.

---

## Accessibility Ethics

Accessibility is not an add-on.

Vector is designed to:
- Adapt to different physical, sensory, and cognitive abilities
- Support independence and dignity
- Avoid stigmatizing design patterns
- Offer equal system value across all versions

Different versions exist to meet different needs — not to rank users.

---

## Prohibited Use Cases

Vector must not be used for:
- Surveillance or tracking of individuals without consent
- Military targeting or weapon guidance
- Manipulation, coercion, or behavioral control
- Medical diagnosis without certified medical oversight
- Law enforcement profiling or social scoring systems

---

## Evolution and Accountability

As technology evolves, Vector’s ethical framework must evolve with it — without compromising core principles.

Hardware may change.  
AI models may improve.  
Ethics remain constant.

---

## Closing Statement

Vector is not just an assistive system.  
It is a responsibility.

Technology should extend human capability —  
not replace humanity.
